Title: Cross-correlation of time series (which may be unevenly sampled)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Simon", "Vaughan", email = "svdataman@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimate the cross-correlation between two time series which may 
  be irregularly and/or non-simultaneously sampled. The CCF is computed using
  one of two methods: (1) the Discrete Correlation Function (DCF; Edelson &
  Krolik 1988) or (2) the Interpolated Cross Correlation Function (ICCF; Gaskell 
  & Sparke 1986). You can also produce estimates of uncertainty on the CCF, its 
  peak and centroid using the Flux Randomisation and Random Subsample Selection
  (FR/RSS) method of Peterson et al. (1998).
